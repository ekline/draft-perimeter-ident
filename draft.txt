Internet-Draft      Default Perimeter Identification           July 2012


1.  Introduction

   Automatic, simple identification of when traffic is crossing a
   perimeter is highly desirable for a variety of home network uses.
   This document proposes a set of default tests to be applied to
   traffic scheduled for forwarding, which can be used collectively to
   identify this perimeter.

   Of note are several limitations introduced by the use of "native"-
   style Internet access methods.  By design these architectures make it
   difficult at best to distinguish any difference between a LAN port in
   an enterprise and a home Internet connection.

   Nevertheless, where practical, an automated mechanism of perimeter
   discovery permits home devices to define default definitions of the
   "interior", i.e. the home, and the "exterior", usually the greater
   Internet.  Once indentified, a device could apply default security
   policies to traffic transiting the perimeter.

   Specifying a policy that should be applied to traffic crossing this
   perimeter is out of scope of this document.  Implementors should
   remain mindful of recommended practices, e.g.  RFC 4864 [RFC4864], et
   cetera.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   In order to address perimeter identification at a manageable scale
   the scope has been limited to discussing concepts of "interior",
   "exterior", and "perimeter".  Working definitions in use by this
   document are as follows.

   Interior
           The interior is broadly defined to include the collection of
           interfaces (physical or virtual), nodes, and forwarding next-
           hops collectively under the control of a single logical
           administrative domain.

   Exterior
           The exterior is broadly defined to include all interfaces
           (physical or virtual), nodes, and forwarding next-hops
           collectively NOT under the control of any single logical



Kline                   Expires January 27, 2013                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft      Default Perimeter Identification           July 2012


           administrative domain and specifically NOT under the control
           of the administrative domain which defines the interior.

   Perimeter
           The perimeter is taken to be the collection of all ephemeral
           demarcations within the collection of interior nodes which
           forward traffic such that any IP packet transiting that
           demarcation can be said to be crossing either from the
           interior toward the exterior or from the exterior toward the
           interior.  This is independent of whether or not such traffic
           is permitted by policy to complete its transiting from one
           zone to the other.

   Expressly not discussed herein are concepts of multiple interior
   networks, nor any relationships between them as separate from their
   relationship to their common exterior or any common perimeter.  The
   architectures under discussion have a single interior, single
   exterior, and a single perimeter.

   The definition of perimeter is such that, for example, an IP packet
   arriving on a NAT device's interior interface that is "hairpinned"
   and retransmitted out the interior interface is not considered to
   have touched nor crossed the perimeter.

   The definition of perimeter as written technically permits traffic
   being forwarded over an interface to be classified as transiting a
   perimeter or not based on the classification of the next-hop.  The
   implications of this are discussed in TBD.


3.  Fundamental recommendations

3.1.  Network node default security practices

   By default all network nodes SHOULD follow best current security
   practices.  Any node may at times find itself in a hostile
   environment.  This is obviously true of mobile nodes when, for
   instance, connecting to a variety of public "Wi-Fi" networks.  In
   such environments mobile nodes cannot be sure that network device is
   acting in its own best security interests with respect to others on
   the local network.

   It is equally true of more traditionally "fixed" nodes: any
   compromised neighbor nodes ("fixed" or mobile) may be used as a
   conduit for further compromise.  Indeed, one study of a captured
   "botnet" ([TORPIG], section 5.2.4) found that roughly 78.9% of
   infected hosts had RFC 1918 [RFC1918] addresses, commmonly used in
   IPv4 NAT deployments.

Internet-Draft      Default Perimeter Identification           July 2012


3.2.  Logging

   Nodes compliant with this and other homenet documents SHOULD
   administratively log the perimeter classification of interfaces (both
   physical and virtual), the reason(s) for such classification, and
   times at which such classifications are made or changed.


4.  Useful perimeter signals

   This is a non-trivial task as it is tantamount to automated discovery
   of administrative boundaries.

   Many architectures fundamentally make it difficult or impossible to
   detect administrative boundaries and rely on various mechanisms of
   user or administrator invention to create or modify such boundaries.
   Other hints about administrative boundaries are insecure, unreliable,
   or impractical. [router peering and reverse IP DNS delegation
   examples]

   Nevertheless there are some guidelines that may be useful, though it
   is stressed that nothing is likely to be more secure than boundary
   detection by way of authenticated communication protocols (e.g. an
   authenticated interior routing protocol).

   This document discusses interfaces, traffic traversing them, whether
   doing so should be considered as crossing a perimeter, and which
   interfaces are "interior" versus "exterior".  There may be multiple
   interior interfaces as well as multiple exterior interfaces.  Notions
   of perimeter between pairs of exterior interfaces are out of scope,
   as are notions of perimeter between multiple interior interfaces
   (e.g., a home router with wired and "guest" wireless networks).

4.1.  Links requiring subscriber information

   Perhaps the most obvious administrative boundary is a link that
   requires subscriber credentials in order for that link to
   successfully forward and receive general traffic.  Examples include
   authenticated PPPoE sessions, 3G/LTE PDP contexts (requiring a SIM
   card associated with a customer account), and authenticated VPN
   links.  By default, all traffic traversing such a link SHOULD be
   considered to be traversing a boundary.

4.2.  Links requiring existing IP-layer connectivity

   E.g.  Teredo, 6to4, 6rd, 4rd, PPTP/L2TP tunnels, ...

Internet-Draft      Default Perimeter Identification           July 2012


4.3.  Routing adjacency

   authenticated, secure Undoubtedly the most reliable method for
   perimeter detection may be all interfaces that form an authenticated
   adjacency to...  Discuss: [two routers each sharing a hub with two
   upstreams on it]

   Routing protocol could further define security zones so that the
   rules among interiors and among exteriors could be defined...

4.4.  on-link neighbor communications

   Most home networking technology supports two nodes on the same
   logical link communicating directly.  By default, traffic traversing
   from such a link to one on which no on-link neighbor discovery and/or
   communication is permitted, either by design (e.g. a point-to-point
   link) or administrative choice (e.g. an 802.11 SSID on which the
   infrastructural access point forbids direct neighbor communications)
   SHOULD be considered as crossing an administrative boundary and
   therefore SHOULD be considered as crossing a security perimeter.

   Discuss: same for tunneled protocols where "point-to-point" isn't
   necessarily a requirement, e.g. 6to4.

   Note that it would be insecure to consider a link on which a default
   router had disabled on-link determination via flags in the IPv6 RA as
   changing from security perimeter to interior as such a router may not
   actually be part of the interior's administrative domain.

4.5.  Product-defined interface purposes

   Many products come with interfaces labeled with their intended use.
   Examples include home routers with RJ-45 ports labeled "WAN" and
   "LAN", or perhaps with symbols indicating "The Internet" and "inside
   the home".  Other examples include wireless routers with defined WLAN
   and "Guest" ESSIDs.  In such cases where concepts of "interior" and
   "exterior" are clearly implied a homenet router SHOULD by default
   consider traffic forwarded between interfaces of differing regions as
   traversing a boundary.

4.6.  DHCPv6 PD, if and only if...

   DHCPv6 PD is at this time the most common method for supplying SoHo
   networks with a routable prefix block.

   If (and only if) a means of distributing prefixes among interior
   routers is devised that does NOT use DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation, then a
   link on which DHCPv6 PD succeeded SHOULD be considered an

Internet-Draft      Default Perimeter Identification           July 2012


   administrative boundary and traffic traversing this interface SHOULD
   be considered to be traversing a security perimeter.

   If PD is to be used within the interior where a single security
   policy is desired to be in effect, then this signal is not useful.


5.  Additional considerations

5.1.  Physical vs virtual interfaces

   In certain configurations it may be desirable that the perimeter
   defined on a virtual interface also be extended to include the
   physical interface(s) over which such traffic is forwarded/received.
   For example, consider a router configured with a PPPoE virtual
   interface on a physical 802.3 interface.  In such a configuration,
   the security policy applied to traffic transitting the PPPoE
   interface should most likely also be applied to non-PPPoE traffic
   transitting the physical interface.  If not, the "interior" region
   would otherwise be logically extended to include the upstream access
   link.  As there is no guaranteed of administrative boundary XXX, a
   default configuration SHOULD consider the physical interface a
   perimeter.

   By way of contrast, consider an entirely interior router which also
   has a VPN interface, through which traffic may be passed to, say, a
   resident's company network.  While a VPN virtual interface SHOULD be
   considered a logical demarcation point, the physical interface
   through which VPN-encapsulated traffic is transmitted need not
   necessarily be classified as such.  Instead, what may be desired is
   that traffic to/from interfaces that are interior to this VPN-enabled
   router may pass through either the VPN interface or any "upstream"
   interfaces, but traffic originating from "upstream" interfaces may be
   default DENIED transit through the VPN interface.  While this
   situation may be far from the norm for networks, it nevertheless
   affords the maintenance of a simple mental model of a hierarchical
   network.

   To address these uses, by default the physical interface(s) through
   which a virtual interface's traffic is forward should also be
   considered a perimeter, unless other means determine that it is in
   fact an interior interface.  Note that in all cases such a virtual
   interface is considered a perimeter.

   Discuss: applying the policy to the entire interface for some
   "infrastructural" connections (e.g.  PPPoE).  Virtual link versus
   physical link, virtual interface versus physical interface.

5.2.  Mixed zone next-hops on the same interface

   By default, if one then all.

5.3.  Perimeter and address families

   Same in IPvv4 and IPv6.  Anything else will violate principle of
   least surprise, and may lead to a deployment in an insecure
   configuration.


6.  Ignore these old scribblings

   Assumptions include:

   A mechanism exists to manually override these defaults.  RA-guard is
   sensibly, universally in effect.  Something other than DHCPv6-PD will
   be used within the home (eventually) to distribute prefixes.  By
   default, unless manually configured otherwise, traffic received or to
   be sent: via interfaces which are point-to-point (e.g., PPP(oE)
   interfaces, L2TP/VPNs/tunnels in general, et cetera), or via next-
   hops which issued an RA in which on-link computation was disabled
   (TODO: exception text for link types where !on-link is normal, e.g.
   LLN if the forwarding device in question is, say, a 6LBR), or via
   interfaces from which a prefix has been delegated via DHCPv6-PD, or
   via interfaces which have NO RFC3484(bis) global scope addresses of
   the same family as the passing traffic, or via next-hops which are
   NOT participating in an authenticated routing domain, when an
   authenticated routing domain is otherwise in use, MUST be considered
   as crossing a perimeter.  TODO: see if we can rewrite this as an
   ordered set of tests or rules.  [RTDDOM] By default, unless manually
   configured otherwise, traffic received from or to be sent via next-
   hops which are NOT participating in an authenticated routing domain
   when an authenticated routing domain is otherwise in use SHOULD be
   considered as crossing a perimeter.  [PPPTUN] By default, unless
   manually configured otherwise, traffic received or to be sent via
   interfaces which are point-to-point in nature or are tunnel/
   encapsulated interfaces SHOULD be considered as crossing a perimeter.
   Examles of interfaces that by default would form a perimeter include
   PPP, PPPoE, PPPoA, L2TP tunnel interfaces, and typical VPN
   interfaces.  This also includes Teredo, 6to4, 6rd, and 4rd
   interfaces.

   The CDATA means you don't need to escape meta-characters (especially

10.  More about Lists

   Lists with 'hanging labels': the list item is indented the amount of
   the hangIndent:

   short   With a label shorter than the hangIndent.

   fantastically long label  With a label longer than the hangIndent.

   vspace_trick
           Forces the new item to start on a new line.

   Simulating more than one paragraph in a list item using <vspace>:

   a.  First, a short item.

   b.  Second, a longer list item.

       And something that looks like a separate pararaph..

   Simple indented paragraph using the "empty" style:

             fool many another hunter in the great wood in the west.

10.1.  Numbering Lists across Lists and Sections

   Numbering items continuously although they are in separate <list>
   elements, maybe in separate sections using the "format" style and a
   "counter" variable.

   First list:
