Abstract

   Automatic, simple identification of when traffic is crossing a
   perimeter is highly desirable for a variety of home network uses.
   This document proposes a set of default tests to be applied to
   traffic scheduled for forwarding, which can be used collectively to
   identify this perimeter.

Internet-Draft      Default Perimeter Identification           July 2012


1.  Introduction

   Automatic, simple identification of when traffic is crossing a
   perimeter is highly desirable for a variety of home network uses.
   This document proposes a set of default tests to be applied to
   traffic scheduled for forwarding, which can be used collectively to
   identify this perimeter.

   Specifying a policy that should be applied to traffic crossing this
   perimeter is out of scope of this document.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Assumptions

   Assumptions include:

   A mechanism exists to manually override these defaults.  RA-guard is
   sensibly, universally in effect.  Something other than DHCPv6-PD will
   be used within the home (eventually) to distribute prefixes.  By
   default, unless manually configured otherwise, traffic received or to
   be sent: via interfaces which are point-to-point (e.g., PPP(oE)
   interfaces, L2TP/VPNs/tunnels in general, et cetera), or via next-
   hops which issued an RA in which on-link computation was disabled
   (TODO: exception text for link types where !on-link is normal, e.g.
   LLN if the forwarding device in question is, say, a 6LBR), or via
   interfaces from which a prefix has been delegated via DHCPv6-PD, or
   via interfaces which have NO RFC3484(bis) global scope addresses of
   the same family as the passing traffic, or via next-hops which are
   NOT participating in an authenticated routing domain, when an
   authenticated routing domain is otherwise in use, MUST be considered
   as crossing a perimeter.  TODO: see if we can rewrite this as a set
   of tests, and make ordering important.  [RTDDOM] By default, unless
   manually configured otherwise, traffic received from or to be sent
   via next-hops which are NOT participating in an authenticated routing
   domain when an authenticated routing domain is otherwise in use
   SHOULD be considered as crossing a perimeter.  [PPPTUN] By default,
   unless manually configured otherwise, traffic received or to be sent
   via interfaces which are point-to-point in nature or are tunnel/
   encapsulated interfaces SHOULD be considered as crossing a perimeter.
   Examles of interfaces that by default would form a perimeter include
   PPP, PPPoE, PPPoA, L2TP tunnel interfaces, and typical VPN
   interfaces.  This also includes Teredo, 6to4, 6rd, and 4rd

   interfaces.


3.  Simple List

   List styles: 'empty', 'symbols', 'letters', 'numbers', 'hanging',
   'format'.

   o  First bullet

   o  Second bullet

   You can write text here as well.


4.  Figures

   Figures should not exceed 69 characters wide to allow for the indent
   of sections.

                 Preamble text - can be omitted or empty.

   +-----------------------+
   | Use XML, be Happy :-) |
   |_______________________|

        Cross-references allowed in pre- and postamble. [min_ref].

                                 Figure 1

   The CDATA means you don't need to escape meta-characters (especially
   < (&lt;) and & (&amp;)) but is not essential.  Figures may also have
   a title attribute but it won't be displayed unless there is also an
   anchor.  White space, both horizontal and vertical, is significant in
   figures even if you don't use CDATA.


5.  Subsections and Tables

5.1.  A Subsection

   By default 3 levels of nesting show in table of contents but that can
   be adjusted with the value of the "tocdepth" processing instruction.

5.2.  Tables

   .. are very similar to figures:

     Tables use ttcol to define column headers and widths.  Every cell
                  then has a "c" element for its content.

                          +----------+----------+
                          | ttcol #1 | ttcol #2 |
                          +----------+----------+
                          |   c #1   |   c #2   |
                          |   c #3   |   c #4   |
                          |   c #5   |   c #6   |
                          +----------+----------+

                      which is a very simple example.

6.  More about Lists

   Lists with 'hanging labels': the list item is indented the amount of
   the hangIndent:

   short   With a label shorter than the hangIndent.

   fantastically long label  With a label longer than the hangIndent.

   vspace_trick
           Forces the new item to start on a new line.

   Simulating more than one paragraph in a list item using <vspace>:

   a.  First, a short item.

   b.  Second, a longer list item.

       And something that looks like a separate pararaph..

   Simple indented paragraph using the "empty" style:

             The quick, brown fox jumped over the lazy dog and lived to
             fool many another hunter in the great wood in the west.

6.1.  Numbering Lists across Lists and Sections

   Numbering items continuously although they are in separate <list>
   elements, maybe in separate sections using the "format" style and a
   "counter" variable.

   First list:

Internet-Draft      Default Perimeter Identification           July 2012


   R1  #1

   R2  #2

   R3  #3

   Specify the indent explicitly so that all the items line up nicely.

   Second list:

   R4  #4

   R5  #5

   R6  #6

6.2.  Where the List Numbering Continues

   List continues here.

   Third list:

   R7   #7

   R8   #8

   R9   #9

   R10  #10

   The end of the list.


7.  Acknowledgements

   This template was derived from an initial version written by Pekka
   Savola and contributed by him to the xml2rfc project.

   This document is part of a plan to make xml2rfc indispensable
   [DOMINATION].


8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs

   [RFC5226] for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do
   anything, the section contains an explicit statement that this is the
   case (as above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section
   will be removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.


9.  Security Considerations

   All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
   See RFC 3552 [RFC3552] for a guide.
